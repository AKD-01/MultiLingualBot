**mlb_config.ini** is the overall config file for the bot

You then have a Rasa NLU config file corresponding to each language that the bot is to be trained with.

By default there are Rasa NLU config files for English, French and German:

- mlb_config_en.json
- mlb_config_fr.json
- mlb_config_de.json
